# Starkers-11ty
A clean/basic blank portfolio site using 11ty

To make this website load with gitpages, you need to amend the file (line ..) and change '_site' to 'docs'. You also need to create a .nojekyll file

The css will have just a reset and you can add on top

The code will be just html with the only js being the hamburger menu

The site will have accessibility built within from scratch

It will have full semantic html from the start

The site will use decapcms as admin
